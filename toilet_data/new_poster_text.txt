Pride month is there! We want to hear who you are interested!! We had the suspicion that our campus is a little more diverse than the average population and based on the reults we think that this can be confirmed. The biggest group are the mostly straight people still but only by a rather small margin. Interestingly, that's also the only group with more people in committed relationships (at least the only one where both sides are present in the data). I wonder whether that's an actual trend or just randomness. Other than that the results speak for themselves - we love everyone our community!!
