Leeuwarden was of interest in week 6 of the bathroom data! More specifically, we wanted to give you an opportunity to express your love or hate for the city. The results seem to indicate much more love than hate for the city with a majority at least liking the city. Contrary to our expections even the big city kids like it around here! We thought Leeuwarden's cuteness is an asset but the lack of happenings may be a downside compared to the standards of (other) bigger cities. We are glad you like it around here and feel sorry for the few that don't! Hopefully you surround yourself with some nice people to enjoy your time here despite Leeuwarden!
